# REST API

## Getting started

Clone this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:project-ada/rest-api-challenge.git
    cd rest-api-challenge

Install dependencies using yarn:

    yarn

This repository contains a simple REST API built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/). To launch the server, run:

    yarn run start

To run the tests, run:

    yarn run test

## The challenge

You will find a test suite in `__test__/app.spec.js`. Initially, none of the tests pass. Make changes to `app.js` until the first test passes. Then move on to the next test (replace `it.skip` with `it` and the test runner will start executing that test).
